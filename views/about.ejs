      Pen and Pixel is a simple blog platform built as a personal learning
      project. It was created to help me understand how to work with Node.js,
      Express, and EJS templates — and to put into practice what I’ve been
      learning about building web apps. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Here’s what you can do on this site: <br /> </b>📝 Create blog posts
      <br />
      👀 View them like a casual feed <br />
      🛠️ Edit or delete posts <br />
      <br />
      That’s pretty much it! It’s not fancy — just a clean and basic project
      that helped me get more confident with backend development and templating
      in EJS. <br />
      Thanks for checking it out! <3
